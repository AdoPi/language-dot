# Dot language (GraphViz) support for Atom

This package adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Dot files in Atom.

The snippets are the representation of what I find useful.
You can add them by using a pull request.

Obviously, you can also add grammar tweaks (for colorschemes) and report issues.

## Installing

It is available at atom package, you can install it by using the apm manager.
